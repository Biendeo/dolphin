I've only tested it so far on Linux, but it should build fine on Windows.

Feedback is welcome, as its very buggy currently.

At the moment it only shows up as a plugged in device, and probably does not pass the USB descriptors correctly.

The QT code is probably messed up too, as the window doesn't appear independently of the main Dolphin window. I'll probably fix that after I get the mic emulation itself working.
